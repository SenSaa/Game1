# Game1
A simple game where scoring occurs once the rectangular base (horizontally-moving) shape makes contact with the square (vertically-moving) shape. The game can be either controlled by tilt (accelerometer) or by touch (touching the left side screen moves the base shape left, and the right side moves the base shape right). The pace of the game becomes faster for every 5 points scored.
